## Polynomial rings

For our work on polynomial rings, we assume our ring $R$ is a commutative ring with $1$.

The polynomial ring $R[x]$ is defined as

$$
R[x] = \curlies{a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0 : a_0, ..., a_n \in R, n \in \N}
$$

### Polynomial rings over integral domains

Suppose $R$ is an integral domain, then

- if $p(x), q(x) \in R[x]$, then $\deg p(x) + \deg q(x) = \deg p(x)q(x)$ (since the highest power term of $p(x)q(x)$ is the product of the highest degree terms of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, and this product is never 0 because $R$ is an in integral domain)
- the units of $R[x]$ are the units of $R$
- $R[x]$ is an integral domain
- the quotient field of $R[x]$ is the set of rational functions over $R$

### Polynomials from ideals of $R$

Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$, then $I[x]$ is the ideal generated by $I$ in $R[x]$, i.e. $I[x] = (I)$.

Furthermore, $R[x] / (I) \cong (R / I)[x]$.

Suppose $I$ is a prime ideal of $R$, then $R/I$ is an integral domain. This means that $(R/I)[x] = R[x]/(I)$ is an integral domain, which means that $(I)$ is a prime ideal in $R[x]$. Thus, if $I$ is a prime ideal of $R$ then $I[x]$ is a prime ideal of $R[x]$.

### Polynomials in multiple variables

We define the set of polynomials in two variables $R[x, y]$ as $(R[x])[y]$. Similarly, we can can inductively define $R[x_1, ..., x_{n+1}]$ as $R[x_1, ..., x_n][x_{n+1}]$ for all $n$.

For a monomial $x_1^{a_1} ... x_n^{a_n}$, we define the degree as $a_1 + ... + a_n$. We define the degree of a polynomial in $R[x_1, ..., x_n]$ as the greatest degree of its terms.

A polynomial in $R[x_1, ..., x_n]$ is homogeneous of degree $k$ if each of its terms has degree $k$.

We can uniquely decompose a polynomial in $p(x_1, ..., x_n) \in R[x_1, ..., x_n]$ into its homogenous components. Suppose $\deg p(x_1, ..., x_n) = m$, then we can write

$$
p(x_1, ..., x_n) = \sum_{i=0}^m p_i(x_1, ..., x_n)
$$

where each $p_i$ is homogenous of degree $i$. We can do this decomposition by letting each $p_i$ be the sum of the terms of $p$ of degree $i$.

### Polynomials over fields

If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain with the norm $N(p(x)) = \deg p(x)$.

$F[x, y]$ is a UFD, however it is not a PID. For example, $(x, y)$ is not a principal ideal. Thus, it is not a Euclidean domain.
