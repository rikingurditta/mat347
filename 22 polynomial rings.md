## Polynomial rings

For our work on polynomial rings, we assume our ring $R$ is a commutative ring with $1$.

The polynomial ring $R[x]$ is defined as

$$
R[x] = \curlies{a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0 : a_0, ..., a_n \in R, n \in \N}
$$

### Polynomial rings over integral domains

Suppose $R$ is an integral domain, then

- if $p(x), q(x) \in R[x]$, then $\deg p(x) + \deg q(x) = \deg p(x)q(x)$ (since the highest power term of $p(x)q(x)$ is the product of the highest degree terms of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, and this product is never 0 because $R$ is an in integral domain)
- the units of $R[x]$ are the units of $R$
- $R[x]$ is an integral domain
- the quotient field of $R[x]$ is the set of rational functions over $R$

### Polynomials from ideals of $R$

Let $I$ be an ideal of $R$, then $I[x]$ is the ideal generated by $I$ in $R[x]$, i.e. $I[x] = (I)$.

Furthermore, $R[x] / (I) \cong (R / I)[x]$.

Suppose $I$ is a prime ideal of $R$, then $R/I$ is an integral domain. This means that $(R/I)[x] = R[x]/(I)$ is an integral domain, which means that $(I)$ is a prime ideal in $R[x]$. Thus, if $I$ is a prime ideal of $R$ then $I[x]$ is a prime ideal of $R[x]$.

### Polynomials in multiple variables

We define the set of polynomials in two variables $R[x, y]$ as $(R[x])[y]$. Similarly, we can can inductively define $R[x_1, ..., x_{n+1}]$ as $R[x_1, ..., x_n][x_{n+1}]$ for all $n$.

For a monomial $x_1^{a_1} ... x_n^{a_n}$, we define the degree as $a_1 + ... + a_n$. We define the degree of a polynomial in $R[x_1, ..., x_n]$ as the greatest degree of its terms.

A polynomial in $R[x_1, ..., x_n]$ is homogeneous of degree $k$ if each of its terms has degree $k$.

We can uniquely decompose a polynomial in $p(x_1, ..., x_n) \in R[x_1, ..., x_n]$ into its homogenous components. Suppose $\deg p(x_1, ..., x_n) = m$, then we can write

$$
p(x_1, ..., x_n) = \sum_{i=0}^m p_i(x_1, ..., x_n)
$$

where each $p_i$ is homogenous of degree $i$. We can do this decomposition by letting each $p_i$ be the sum of the terms of $p$ of degree $i$.

### Polynomials over fields

If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain with the norm $N(p(x)) = \deg p(x)$.

$F[x, y]$ is a UFD, however it is not a PID. For example, $(x, y)$ is not a principal ideal. Thus, it is not a Euclidean domain.

## Polynomial rings and UFDs

### Gauss' lemma

Suppose $R$ is a UFD with quotient field $F$. Let $p(x) \in R[x]$. If $p(x)$ is reducible in $F[x]$, then it is reducible in $R[x]$.

So if $p(x) = A(x) B(x)$ for polynomials $A(x), B(x) \in F[x]$, then $p(x) = a'(x) b'(x)$ where $a'(x) = rA(x)$ and $b'(x) = sB(x)$.

[...]

### Corollary: Relatively prime coefficients

Suppose $p(x) \in R[x]$ and its coefficients have a greatest common divisor of 1. Then as a result of Gauss' lemma, $p(x)$ is reducible in $R[x]$ if and only if it is reducible in $F[x]$.

($\Rightarrow$) Gauss' lemma tells us that if $p(x)$ is reducible in $F[x]$, then it is reducible in $R[x]$.

($\Leftarrow$) If we can factor $p(x) = a(x)b(x)$ in $R[x]$, then neither $a$ nor $b$ can be constants, because that would imply that the constant divides every coefficient of $p(x)$. However, the coefficients of $p(x)$ have a greatest common divisor of 1. Thus, $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are nonconstant, so $p(x)$ is reducible in $F[x]$.

Note that monic polynomials have a leading coefficient of 1, so the GCD of their coefficients is always 1, so this theorem applies to them.

### $R$ is a UFD if and only if $R[x]$ is a UFD

($\Leftarrow$) We know that if $R$ is not a unique factorization domain then neither is $R[x]$, since $R \subseteq R[x]$.

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $R$ is a UFD and let $F$ be its field of fractions. Let $p(x) \in R[x]$ and let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of $p(x)$. Then $p(x) = dp'(x)$ for some $p'(x)$ with coefficients whose GCD is 1. We know from the corollary above that $p'(x)$ is irreducible in $R[x]$ if and only if it is irreducible in $F[x]$.

Suppose we can factor $\ds p'(x) = \prod_i p_i(x)$ where each $p_i(x)$ is irreducible in $F[x]$. Then we can write $\ds p(x) = \prod_i r_i p_i(x)$ with each $r_i \in F$ and each $r_i p_i(x) \in R[x]$.

## Criteria for irreducibility

### Factor theorem

Let $F$ be a field. A polynomial $p(x) \in F[x]$ has a linear factor if and only if $p(x)$ has a root in $F$.

As a corollary, if $p(x)$ has degree 2 or 3 but has no roots, then it is irreducible.

As a result, if $p(x)$ has roots $\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_n$ then it has factors $(x - \alpha_1), ..., (x - \alpha_n)$. Furthermore, the number of roots it has cannot exceed its degree.

### Rational root theorem for $\Z[x]$

Suppose $p(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0$. If $r/s \in \Q$ is a root in lowest terms, then $r \divides a_0$ and $s \divides a_n$.

In particular, if $p(x)$ is monic, then every root $r/s$ must have $s \divides a_n = 1$ so $s = 1$, so every root must be an integer

### Monic polynomials and ideals

Suppose $R$ is an integral domain and $p(x) \in R[x]$ is monic and non-constant. Suppose $I$ is a proper ideal of $R$. Then if $\overline{p(x)} \in (R/I)[x]$ is irreducible, then $p(x)$ is irreducible.

The converse of this theorem is not true, for example $x^4 + 1 \in \Z[x]$ is reducible over $\Z/p\Z[x]$ for every $p$, but is still irreducible over $\Z[x]$.

### Maximal ideals of polynomial rings of fields

Suppose $F$ is a field, then the maximal ideals of $F[x]$ are the ideals generated by irreducible polynomials, i.e. the maximal ideals are all of the form $(p(x))$ for some irreducible $p(x) \in F[x]$. This equivalently says that $F[x]/(p(x))$ is a field if and only if $p(x)$ is irreducible.

### Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials

Suppose $F$ is a field and $g(x) \in F[x]$. Suppose it can be factored as

$$
g(x) = f_1^{a_1}(x) \cdot ... \cdot f_k^{a_k}(x)
$$

where each $f_i(x)$ is irreducible and distinct.

Then for every pair $i, j$ the ideals $(f_i^{a_i}(x))$, $(f_j^{a_j}(x))$ are comaximal, so we can apply the Chinese remainder theorem to see that

$$
F[x]/(g(x)) = F[x]/(f_1^{a_1}(x)) \times ... \times F[x]/(f_k^{a_k}(x))
$$

### Finite subgroups of $F^\times$

Suppose $F$ is a field and $G \leq F^\times$ is a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group. Then $G$ is cyclic.

From the fundamental theorem of abelian groups, we know that

$$
G \cong \Z/n_1\Z \times ... \times \Z/n_k\Z
$$

and each $n_i$ divides $n_{i+1}$, i.e. $n_1 \divides n_2$, $n_2 \divides n_3$, ..., $n_{k-1} \divides n_k$.

For any cyclic group $C$, if $d$ divides $\abs C$, then there are $d$ elements of $C$ whose orders divide $d$. $n_1$ divides each of $n_1, ..., n_k$, so for each $i$, there are $n_1$ elements of $\Z/n_i \Z$ whose order divides $n_1$. Each of these elements determines an element of $G$ whose order divides $n_1$.Thus there are at least $k n_1$ elements of $G$ whose order divides $n_1$.

This means that there are at least $kn_1$ elements of $G$ that are roots of the polynomial $p(x) = x^{n_1} - 1$. However, we know from the factor theorem that there can be at most $n_1$ roots of this polynomial, so $k = 1$. This means $G \cong Z/n_1 \Z$, so $G$ is cyclic.

#### Corollary: $(\Z/p\Z)^\times$ is cyclic

$\Z/p\Z$ is a field and $(\Z/p\Z)^\times$ is finite, so by the theorem above, it is cyclic.

## Noetherian rings

A **Noetherian ring** is a commutative ring with $1$ where every ideal is finitely generated.

### Hilbert's basis theorem

If $R$ is Noetherian, then so is $R[x]$.

**Proof.**

Suppose $I \subseteq R[x]$ is an ideal, and let $L$ be the set of all leading coefficients of polynomials in $I$. Then $L$ is an ideal in $R$, because of how polynomials add and multiply. Since $L$ is an ideal of $R$, it is finitely generated, so

$$
L = (a_1, ..., a_n)
$$

These are all leading coefficients in $I$, so there are elements

$$
f_1(x), ..., f_n(x)
$$

so that the leading coefficient of $f_i(x)$ is $a_i(x)$.

Let $d_i = \deg(f_i(x))$, and $N = \max(d_i)$.

If $d < N$, let $L_d$ be the set containing the leading coefficients of all polynomials in $I$ of degree $d$, as well as $0$. Then $L_d$ is an ideal in $R$, so it is finitely generated:

$$
L_d = (b_{d,1}, ..., b_{d,n_d})
$$

so there are polynomials $f_{d,1}(x), ..., f_{d,n_d}(x) \in I$ that all have degree $d$.

Then, we claim that the set

$$
\curlies{f_1(x), ..., f_n(x)} \cup \curlies{f_{d, i} : 0 \leq d < N, 1 \leq i \leq n_d}
$$

generates $R[x]$.

As a corollary, $F[x_1, ...., x_n]$ is Noetherian for every field $F$.
