## Ideals

Suppose $R$ is a ring with identity $1 \neq 0$ and $A \subseteq R$.

Recall that the ideal $(A)$ is the smallest ideal containing $A$, i.e.

$$
(A) = \bigcap_{I \supseteq A \text{ is an ideal}} I
$$

If $A = \curlies{a}$, then $(A) = (a)$, and we call this a principal ideal

If $A = \curlies{a_1, ..., a_n}$ (i.e. $A$ is finite), then $(A) = (a_1, ..., a_n)$ is called a finitely generated ideal

We define $RA = \curlies{r_1 a_1 + ... + r_k a_k : r_i \in R, a_i \in A}$, and similarly define $AR$ and $RAR$. Then $RA$ is the left ideal generated by $A$, $AR$ is the right ideal generated by $A$, and $RAR$ is the two-sided ideal generated by $A$.

### Example: $M_n(F)$

Suppose $F$ is a field, then $M_n(F)$ is the ring of $n \times n$ matrices over $F$.

Let $a = E_{ij}$ (the matrix with a 1 in entry $i,j$ and 0s everywhere else)

Then if $A = \curlies{a}$, then $RAR = R$.

### Example: $(x, 2)$ in $\Z[x]$

Let $I = (x, 2)$ in the ring of polynomials over the integes $\Z[x]$. Then

$$
I = \curlies{a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0 : 2 \divides a_0}
$$

However, $I$ is not a principal ideal:

Suppose $I = (q(x))$ for some polynomial $q$. Then since $2 \in I$, we have $2 = r(x) q(x)$, so $q(x) \in \curlies{\pm 1, \pm 2}$.

$I \neq \Z[x]$, so $q \neq \pm 1$ since $(1) = (-1) = \Z[x]$. Thus, $q = \pm 2$.

However, $x \in I$, but $x \neq r(x) \cdot 2 = \pm r(x) q(x)$

## Units

If $x \in R$ and there exists another element $y \in R$ so that $xy = yx = 1$, then we call $x$ a **unit**.

### $I = R$ if $I$ contains a unit

Let $I \subseteq R$ be an ideal containing a unit $x$. $RI = I$, so $\inv x I = I$, so $\inv x x = 1 \in I$. This means that $R 1 \subseteq I$, so $I = R$.

#### Fields and ideals

Suppose $R$ is a commutative ring. $R$ is a field if and only if its only ideals are $0$ and $R$.

($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $R$ is a field, then every element has a multiplicative inverse, so every element is a unit. So if $I$ is a nonempty ideal, then it contains a unit, so it is equal to $R$.

($\Leftarrow$) Suppose the only ideals of $R$ are $0$ and $R$, and let $x \in R$ be a nonzero element. Then $(x) = R$, so $1 \in (x)$. Since $(x)$ is an ideal, we know $(x) = R(x)$, so $1 = rx$ for some $r \in R$. Thus, $x$ has a multiplicative inverse, $r$. This holds for all nonzero $x \in R$.

## Maximal ideals

Let $R$ be a ring, not necessarily with unit.

An ideal $M$ of $R$ is a **maximal ideal** if there is no ideal $I$ so that $M \subsetneq I \subsetneq R$.

Not every ring has a maximal ideal.

However, if $R$ has a unit $1 \neq 0$, then any ideal $I \neq 0$ is contained in a maximal ideal. (The proof is an application of Zorn's lemma)

### If $R$ is commutative, then $M$ is a maximal ideal if $R/M$ is a field

By the fourth isomorphism theorem, the ideal lattice from $M$ to $R$ corresponds to the ideal lattice from $0$ to $R/M$. Thus, if $M$ is maximal then there are no ideals in the lattice between $M$ and $R$, so $R/M$ has no nontrivial ideals, and ice versa.

## Prime ideals

If $R$ is commutative, an ideal $P$ is a **prime ideal** if whenever $ab \in P$, we know $a \in P$ or $b \in P$.

For example, $(6) \subseteq \Z$ is *not* a prime ideal, since $6 \in (6)$ but $2, 3 \notin (6)$.

### $P$ is a prime ideal if $R/P$ is an integral domain

Recall that an integral domain is a ring with no zero divisors, i.e. no elements $a, b \neq 0$ so that $ab = 0$.

Notice that fields are integral domains, so as a corollary of this theorem we know that maximal ideals are also prime ideals.
