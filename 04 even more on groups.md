## Dihedral groups

A **dihedral group** $D_{2n}$ is the group of rotations and reflections of a regular $n$-gon.

$D_{2n}$ is generated by $r$, a clockwise rotation by $\frac{2\pi}{n}$, and $s$, a reflection over the vertical axis.

Each dihedral group $D_{2n}$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$. In particular, $D_6 \cong S_3$ since $\abs{D_6} = 6 = 3! = \abs{S_3}$.

## Presentations

A **presentation** of a group is specifying a group by its generators and *relations* between them, which are equations that the generators satisfy. For example, $D_{2n}$ is generated by $r$ and $s$, so we write it as
$$
D_{2n} = \angles{r, s \vert r^n = e = s^2, rs = s\inv r}
$$

## Automorphisms

An **automorphism** is an isomorphism between a group and itself.

### Inner automorphisms

If $x \in G$, the map
$$
\begin{align*}
c_x:\;&G \to G \\
&g \mapsto x g\inv x
\end{align*}
$$
is an automorphism.

It is a homomorphism:
$$
\begin{align*}
c_x(gh) &= xgh\inv x \\
&= xgeh\inv x \\
&= xg\inv x xh\inv x \\
&= c_x(g) c_x(h)
\end{align*}
$$
and it is bijective since it has an inverse, since $c_{\inv x} = \inv{(c_x)}$:
$$
\begin{align*}
c_x(c_{\inv x}(g)) &= c_x(\inv x g (\inv x)^{-1}) \\
&= c_x(\inv x g x) \\
&= x(\inv x g x)\inv x \\
&= g
\end{align*}
$$
Automorphisms of this type are called **inner automorphisms**, and other ones are called **outer automorphisms**.

## Centres, centralizers, etc

Taking $g$ and computing $x g \inv x$ is called **conjugating $g$ by $x$**, and $x g \inv x$ is a **conjugate** of $g$.

If $c_x = id$, aka for all $g \in G$, $xg\inv x = g$, then we know $xg = gx$, so $x$ commutes with every element of $G$. In an abelian group, this is the case for every $x$.

The set $\mathcal Z(G) = \curlies{x \in G : \forall g \in G, x g \inv x = g}$, aka the set of elements that commute with every element of $G$, is called the **centre** of $G$. This is a group.

If we fix $x \in G$, we can find the **centralizer of $x$ in $G$**, which is $\mathcal Z_G(x) = \curlies{g \in G : xg = gx}$. This is the subgroup of $G$ where every element commutes with $x$.
